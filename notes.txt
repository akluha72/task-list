        --
    //Laravel Root File
        -- Development and Maintanance 
            -- .env = environment file setup for different 
            -- artisan = php command to be used in cli

            -- gitAttribute = setting git behavior 

        -- Composer
            -- composer.json = a declaration of package that will be used in this frameworks, not supposed to be in the respository
            -- composer.lock = a resolve file from composer.json file that is supposed to be uploaded in repository, so that each developer will have the same setup on the application

        -- Test
            -- phpunit.xml to run unit test and features test
        
        -- FrontEnd 
            -- viteConfig.js = configuration vite/ bundler / combining multiple js and css file *should improve front end and assets efficiency.
            -- package.json = the functionality same as the composer.json but for front end package (NPM)

    // How do you configure laravel apps
        -- using environemnt variable the best way
        -- two enviroment [local, staging, production]
        -- Twelve-Factor app 
            * Store config in environment
        -- local will always use .env configuration
        -- Staging & Production will always use System Environment variable

    // Autoloading and PSRs
        -- namespace = matching the folder name it's being define under composer.json
        -- PSR-4 (Php standard recommendation)

    // Using Artisan Command 
        -- artisan is just a way to run artisan command let you manage laravel project, generate file, clear cache and etc 
        -- php artisan serve
        -- php artisan tinker (playing with your app, before you build all the actual features)
